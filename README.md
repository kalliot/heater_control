boiler_control
=====================
Arduino based house boiler control application. This project is for controlling small house oil burner. It can be modified or parametrised to control also other type heating systems. 
My aim is to control boiler temperature according to needs. For example during nighttime the boiler temperature may be lowered, to diminish loss of heat from boiler surface. 
In the morning the temperature will be raised, by time, or when noticing somebody has need for hot water. Statistics of operation will be sent to AT&T:s excellent M2X IoT cloud.

Getting Started
==========================
1. Get an Arduno board, I have Mega, but Uno is also ok.
2. Get an Arduino Ethernet or WiFi shield to get connected to M2X.
3. Get [arduino dev environment] (http://arduino.cc/en/guide/Environment).
4. Create account for M2X, to get your own feedId and access key.
